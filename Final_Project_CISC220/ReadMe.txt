This program is a rudimentary movie recommendation tool.  All data was obtained from rottentomatoes.com.  This program works by creating a database of movies separated by genre.  A linked list consists of nodes each corresponding to a genre.  Then each node has an AVL tree as a field that holds the movies.  This method of storage allows the database to be organized and quick to traverse.

To run the program, simply compile, run, and follow the directions printed in the console.
